Introduction
============

ChemSpiPy is a Python wrapper that allows simple access to the web APIs offered by ChemSpider. The aim is to provide an
interface for users to access and query the ChemSpider database using Python, facilitating programs that can
automatically carry out the tasks that you might otherwise perform manually via the `ChemSpider website`_.

The RSC website has `full documentation for the ChemSpider APIs`_. It can be useful to browse through this
documentation before getting started with ChemSpiPy to get an idea of what sort of features are available.

All operations require an API key. To obtain one, `Register for a RSC Developers account`_ and then `Add a new key`_.
